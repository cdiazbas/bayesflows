# Simple case: Milne-Eddington atmosphere.

- The generation of the database requires the installation of  `pymilne` - https://github.com/aasensio/milne, `nflows` - https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows, `emcee` - https://github.com/dfm/emcee and `corner` - https://github.com/dfm/corner.py.


## Training and results
- `bayes_inversion.py`: creates conditional normalizing flows for spectropolarimetric inversions
- `mcmc.py`: produces samples from an MCMC code
- `bayes_inversion_datasize.py`: cflows for the datasize experiment
